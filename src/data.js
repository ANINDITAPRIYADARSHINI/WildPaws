The Bengal Tiger populations have plummeted over the years, the animal has been endangered following decades of persistent poaching for its skin and body parts, trophy hunting, and severely reduce habitat from urban development.

As per the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Since 2010, the Asiatic lion has got about 500 to 650 individuals left in the nation, while the animal is mostly confined to the Gir Forest. Most farmers still use crude as well as illegal electrical fence in order to protect their crops and the lions often get caught up in it. Similarly, about 20,000 open wells dug by the farmers in the area for irrigation has led to numerous accidental drowning of the lions.',
